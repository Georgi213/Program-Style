    <div class="card-header">Behavior-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) 
          is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance testers, and customer 
          representatives in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas 
          from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.</p>

  <div class="card text-white bg-secondary mb-3" style="max-width: 40rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Design-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Design driven development uses design as part of a process to learn and better define requirements in order to build better, more informed technology solutions. It can also be
           looked at as a process whereby design and user experience drives the development of a product or software application. This leads to products that people enjoy using and want to tell others about.</p>

  <div class="card text-white bg-success mb-3" style="max-width: 40rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Domain-driven design</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach  focusing on modelling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts.

        In terms of object-oriented programming it means that the structure and language 
        of software code (class names, class methods, class variables) should match the business domain. For example, if a software 
        processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw. </p>

  <div class="card text-white bg-danger mb-3" style="max-width: 40rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Secure by design</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Secure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.
        Alternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architect
        ure, and they are used as guiding principles for developers. It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even tho
        ugh those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind. </p>

  <div class="card text-dark bg-warning mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Test-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.</p>

  <div class="card text-dark bg-info mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Acceptance test-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Acceptance test–driven development (ATDD) is a development methodology based on communication between the business customers, the developers, and the testers.[1] ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example (SBE),[2][3] behavior-driven development (BDD),[4] example-driven development (EDD),[5] and support-driven development also called story test–driven development (SDD).[6] All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language. </p>

  <div class="card text-dark bg-light mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Continuous test-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Continuous test-driven development (CTDD)[1] is a software development practice that extends test-driven development (TDD) by means of automatic test execution in the background, sometimes called continuous testing.[2] </p>
    </div>

  <div class="card text-white bg-dark mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Specification by example</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Specification by example (SBE) is a collaborative approach to defining requirements and business-oriented functional tests for software products based on capturing and illustrating requirements using realistic examples instead of abstract statements.</p>

  <div class="card border-primary mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Data-driven development</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">In computer programming, data-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the program statements describe the data to be matched and the processing required rather than defining a sequence of steps to be taken.[1] Standard examples of data-driven languages are the text-processing languages sed and AWK,[1] where the data is a sequence of lines in an input stream – these are thus also known as line-oriented languages – and pattern matching is primarily done via regular expressions or line numbers. </p>

  <div class="card border-light mb-3" style="max-width: 18rem;">
    <div class="card-header">Data-oriented design</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">In computing, data-oriented design is a program optimization approach motivated by efficient usage of the CPU cache, used in video game development.[1] The approach is to focus on the data layout, separating and sorting fields according to when they are needed, and to think about transformations of data. Proponents include Mike Acton,[2] Scott Meyers,[3] and Jonathan Blow. </p>
